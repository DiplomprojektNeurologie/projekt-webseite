## First Milestone Completed

The first milestone of the neurology project has been finished. Alexander Zmugg has finished cleaning up the raw data. Now Felix Kampas and Dominik Bosnic can start analyzing the data and Philip Damianik can finish setting up the database. The milestone is a bit overdue as the cleanup has taken longer than expected, but that shouldn't matter for the rest of the timeline as Philip Damianik has already begun working for the next milestone.
