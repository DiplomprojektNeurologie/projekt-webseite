## Second Milestone Completed

The second milestone of the neurology project has been finished. The database server is now available for all team members and provides a central source of data which can be analyzed. In the next step Felix Kampas and Dominik Bosnic will be analysing the data and its properties to create detailed reports for future medical personal. Additionally Philip Damianik will start with the website providing the projects results.
